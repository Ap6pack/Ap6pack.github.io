### Adjudicator: Correcting Noisy Labels with a KG-Informed Council of LLM Agents


📊 **TECH INSIGHT**


The article introduces "Adjudicator," a novel approach to improving machine learning model accuracy by correcting noisy labels using a knowledge-graph-informed council of large language model (LLM) agents. This method leverages the expertise of multiple LLMs, each possessing different strengths, to assess and rectify erroneous labels in datasets, thus enhancing data quality. The Adjudicator system utilizes a knowledge graph to inform and guide the decision-making process of these LLM agents, ensuring more reliable and precise label corrections.
