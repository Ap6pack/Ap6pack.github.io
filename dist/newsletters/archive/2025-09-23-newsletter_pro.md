### Time-of-Check Time-of-Use Attacks Against LLMs


üß† **AI ADVANCEMENT**


The article discusses a security vulnerability affecting Large Language Models (LLMs) known as Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) attacks. These attacks exploit the delay between when an LLM checks data inputs and when it uses them, potentially allowing adversaries to manipulate the input in the interim and thus influence the model's behavior or output. The article examines the implications of such attacks on LLMs, highlighting the need for improved security measures to protect these models from being exploited. It
