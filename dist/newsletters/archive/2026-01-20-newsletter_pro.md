### Predator Spyware Sample Indicates 'Vendor-Controlled' C2


📊 **TECH INSIGHT**


The article discusses a recent analysis of the Predator spyware, highlighting a significant finding that its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure appears to be vendor-controlled. This implies that the spyware's developers maintain direct oversight and control over its operations, allowing for more sophisticated and targeted attacks. The study reveals that this centralized control could facilitate more efficient exploitation and data exfiltration, as the vendor can quickly deploy updates or changes to the spyware. Such centralized management raises concerns about the potential for widespread surveillance and underscores the

### The Data-Quality Illusion: Rethinking Classifier-Based Quality Filtering for LLM Pretraining


🧠 **AI ADVANCEMENT**


The article "The Data-Quality Illusion: Rethinking Classifier-Based Quality Filtering for LLM Pretraining" delves into the effectiveness of using classifier-based approaches to filter data quality in the pretraining of large language models (LLMs). It argues that the prevalent belief in the sufficiency of these classifiers to enhance model performance may be misplaced. The authors suggest that these filtering methods might not always accurately measure data quality and, consequently, could limit the model’s potential by excluding valuable data.
