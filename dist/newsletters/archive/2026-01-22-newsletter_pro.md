### Why it’s critical to move beyond overly aggregated machine-learning metrics


🧠 **AI ADVANCEMENT**


The article discusses the limitations of relying solely on aggregated machine-learning metrics, such as accuracy or F1 scores, to evaluate model performance. These metrics can obscure nuances and biases within the data, potentially leading to biased or unfair outcomes, particularly for smaller or marginalized groups. The author argues for a more granular approach to assessment that considers disaggregated metrics, qualitative evaluations, and user-centric validations. This approach enhances transparency, fairness, and effectiveness by providing a deeper understanding of the model’s strengths and weaknesses across
