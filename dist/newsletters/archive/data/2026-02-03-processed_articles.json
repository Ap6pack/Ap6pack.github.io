By employing distributionally robust optimization (DRO), the proposed method, RobustDebias, aims to minimize the influence of biased data distributions on model outputs. The authors argue that traditional debiasing techniques often fall short by neglecting the underlying data distribution issues, whereas their DRO-based approach provides a more reliable framework for addressing these biases systematically.
