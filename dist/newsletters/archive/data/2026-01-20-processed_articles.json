        "summary": "The article discusses a recent analysis of the Predator spyware, highlighting a significant finding that its command-and-control (C2) infrastructure appears to be vendor-controlled. This implies that the spyware's developers maintain direct oversight and control over its operations, allowing for more sophisticated and targeted attacks. The study reveals that this centralized control could facilitate more efficient exploitation and data exfiltration, as the vendor can quickly deploy updates or changes to the spyware. Such centralized management raises concerns about the potential for widespread surveillance and underscores the",
