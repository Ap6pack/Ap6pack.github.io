        "summary": "This article discusses a novel approach for node-level anomaly detection by integrating both Euclidean and hyperbolic representations. Traditional methods primarily focus on either Euclidean spaces, which excel in local structure representation, or hyperbolic spaces, known for capturing hierarchical structures efficiently. The proposed framework leverages the strengths of both geometries to enhance detection accuracy, recognizing anomalies that might be missed when using a single space. By combining these representations, the model achieves a more comprehensive understanding of data, allowing for improved anomaly detection",
