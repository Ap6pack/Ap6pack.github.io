        "summary": "The article discusses a sophisticated cyberattack technique where adversaries deploy their own virtual machines (VMs) within a target's network to maintain persistence. This method allows attackers to operate in a controlled environment, bypassing traditional security measures and evading detection. The use of VMs provides the attackers with a flexible platform to execute malicious activities, such as data exfiltration and lateral movement, without leaving noticeable traces. This new tactic highlights the evolving landscape of cyber threats and underscores the need for enhanced security strategies",
