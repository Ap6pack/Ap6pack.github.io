        "summary": "Malware authors are increasingly utilizing large language models (LLMs) to enhance their evasion techniques against security systems. By leveraging the sophisticated capabilities of LLMs, attackers are able to dynamically generate and modify malicious code, making it more difficult for traditional security tools to detect and thwart these threats. Additionally, LLMs can be employed to create convincing phishing messages and automate social engineering attacks, further complicating the defense landscape. As the use of LLMs in cybercrime grows, cybersecurity professionals face",
