This method leverages the expertise of multiple LLMs, each possessing different strengths, to assess and rectify erroneous labels in datasets, thus enhancing data quality. The Adjudicator system utilizes a knowledge graph to inform and guide the decision-making process of these LLM agents, ensuring more reliable and precise label corrections.",
