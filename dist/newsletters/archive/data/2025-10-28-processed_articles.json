        "summary": "The article discusses the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and secure messaging platforms, emphasizing the need for robust user controls in their interaction. With the increasing integration of AI technologies into secure messaging systems, there are concerns about data privacy and user security. The article argues that users should have the ability to determine how their data is used and be assured of its confidentiality, advocating for transparent AI models and stringent privacy measures. These controls ensure that while users can benefit from enhanced communication tools, their personal information remains protected",
