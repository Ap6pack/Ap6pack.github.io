The methodology focuses on enhancing real-time prediction accuracy by transforming input features into tokenized formats that a transformer model can process efficiently. This model leverages machine learning to analyze vast datasets, including weather conditions, flight paths, and air traffic, to make precise arrival time predictions. The proposed system aims to improve operational efficiency and reliability in the aviation industry by providing more accurate ETA forecasts, thus",
