        "summary": "Chinese state-sponsored hackers have developed a sophisticated rootkit to stealthily embed and conceal the ToneShell malware within infected systems. This tactic allows the attackers to maintain persistent access to compromised networks while evading detection from security mechanisms. The rootkit's primary function is to hide the presence and activity of this malware, making it challenging for cybersecurity teams to identify and address the breach. By employing these advanced techniques, the attackers can conduct prolonged espionage operations, potentially targeting sensitive data and critical infrastructure. This development highlights",
