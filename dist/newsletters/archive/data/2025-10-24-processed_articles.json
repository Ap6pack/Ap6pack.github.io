SNI, although essential for directing internet traffic to the correct servers, exposes domain names in plaintext, potentially compromising user privacy. ECH addresses this issue by encrypting the Client Hello message in the TLS handshake process, preventing eavesdroppers from accessing domain information. The implementation of ECH marks a significant step forward in enhancing",
