This shift allows cybercriminals to exploit the botnet for anonymous web traffic routing, making it more challenging for authorities to trace malicious online activities. The transformation was identified through observed changes in the botnet's command and control infrastructure and the software it deploys on compromised devices. This evolution reflects a broader trend in cybercrime where attackers adapt strategies",
