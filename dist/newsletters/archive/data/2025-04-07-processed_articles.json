        "summary": "SeedLM is a novel approach to reducing the storage requirements of large language models (LLMs) by compressing their weights into seeds for pseudo-random generators. This method leverages the observation that the vast parameter spaces of LLMs, while crucial for their performance capabilities, can be efficiently encoded using much smaller seed values. By generating weights from these seeds rather than storing the full weights explicitly, SeedLM aims to drastically lower the memory footprint of deploying LLMs. This could democratize access to advanced"
