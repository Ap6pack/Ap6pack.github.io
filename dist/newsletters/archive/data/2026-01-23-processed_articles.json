        "summary": "The article discusses the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence technologies that are increasingly adept at identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in internet systems. As AI systems become more sophisticated, they are capable of scanning vast amounts of data to uncover security weaknesses that were previously undetectable by traditional means. This has brought about both positive and negative implications: on one hand, AI tools can aid cybersecurity experts in enhancing protection measures and patching vulnerabilities more efficiently. On the other hand, malicious actors can also use AI to automate attacks and exploit",
