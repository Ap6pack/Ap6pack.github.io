SDB is modular, allowing users to customize the evaluation process to fit specific needs and data types. It aims to provide a standardized approach to assess the quality and utility of synthetic data generated for various applications, ensuring that it accurately mimics real-world data in critical aspects. The authors highlight the significance of SDB in advancing the field of synthetic data",

The proposed model, AgREE, adopts an agentic reasoning approach, employing a combination of machine learning techniques and dynamic knowledge inference to predict missing links effectively. By leveraging agentic intelligence, AgREE is able to dynamically adapt to new information and make informed predictions even in cases where entities are newly introduced and sparsely connected",
