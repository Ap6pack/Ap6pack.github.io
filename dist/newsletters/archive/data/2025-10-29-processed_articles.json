        "summary": "The Aisuru botnet, initially known for orchestrating distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, has transitioned its operations towards the creation of residential proxies. This shift involves hijacking a vast network of compromised devices, repurposing them to reroute internet traffic stealthily. These residential proxies are then rented out, allowing users to mask their digital footprints and bypass geo-restrictions. This evolution in Aisuru's strategy highlights a significant trend among cybercriminals who are exploring more",
