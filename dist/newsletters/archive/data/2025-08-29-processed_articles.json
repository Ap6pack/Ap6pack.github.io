        "summary": "As the adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) grows across various applications, securing them against malicious inputs remains a significant challenge. Despite advancements in AI, these models are vulnerable to exploitation, which can result in unintended outputs or behaviors. Efforts to bolster security include improving data training techniques, implementing robust input filters, and developing advanced monitoring systems. However, the dynamic nature of malicious tactics and the complexity of LLMs make it difficult to provide foolproof defenses. Experts argue for ongoing research and collaboration",
