This method improves the effectiveness of phishing campaigns by creating fake browser windows that closely mimic legitimate authentication prompts, tricking users into disclosing their credentials even with two-factor authentication protections. The Sneaky2FA kit's adoption of the BitB tactic",

The author suggests that the Act's provisions enable government overreach by increasing surveillance capabilities ostensibly to protect children, but in reality, could lead to broader privacy infringements for the general population. Furthermore, the article posits that the Act fails to effectively address the root issues of child safety and instead potentially compromises civil liberties without delivering",
