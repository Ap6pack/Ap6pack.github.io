By using LLMs, these cybercriminals are able to generate more realistic and convincing phishing messages, automate the creation of varied attack scripts, and even adapt their tactics in real-time to avoid detection by security systems. The integration of LLMs into malware design presents significant challenges for cybersecurity professionals, who must now develop more advanced detection techniques to counter these evolving",
