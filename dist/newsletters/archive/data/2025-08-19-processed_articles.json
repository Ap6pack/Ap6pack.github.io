Coreference resolution involves determining when different words refer to the same entity, and biases can lead to systematic errors, especially for marginalized groups. The study highlights that while language models have improved in many areas, they still exhibit biases against intersecting identities, such as those based on race and gender. By analyzing confidence levels, the researchers aim to identify and quantify",
