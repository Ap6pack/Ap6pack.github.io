Federated learning enables the decentralized training of machine learning models across multiple devices without transmitting raw data to a central server, thereby preserving data privacy. In this method, ECG signals are transformed into images using GAF, which capture temporal patterns as spatial features conducive for",

The data reveals a disproportionate focus on vehicles associated with Romani individuals, highlighting systemic biases and racial profiling within law enforcement agencies. The surveillance technology, intended to enhance public safety, has instead perpetuated stereotypes and contributed to the marginalization of the Romani community. The article calls for a critical examination of these practices and urges policymakers to implement measures that protect minority groups from racial profiling and unfair treatment",
