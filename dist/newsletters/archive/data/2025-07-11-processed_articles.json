        "summary": "The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has argued before a Virginia court that law enforcement's practice of obtaining data on everyone who searches for specific keywords online violates constitutional privacy protections. The case highlights concerns regarding \"keyword warrants,\" which could lead to privacy infringements by casting a wide net, potentially targeting innocent individuals. EFF advocates for stringent limitations on such practices, emphasizing the need to uphold the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures in the digital age. The organization warns that allowing these types of warrants",
