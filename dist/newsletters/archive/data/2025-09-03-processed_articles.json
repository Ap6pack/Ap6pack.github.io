By reusing model namespaces, malicious actors can introduce compromised models into AI systems, potentially leading to widespread misinformation or system disruptions. This type of attack leverages the assumption that model names are unique and credible, providing an avenue for attackers to infiltrate and manipulate AI deployments.",
