### EFF Tells Virginia Court That Constitutional Privacy Protections Forbid Cops from Finding out Everyone Who Searched for a Keyword


üìä **TECH INSIGHT**


The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has argued before a Virginia court that law enforcement's practice of obtaining data on everyone who searches for specific keywords online violates constitutional privacy protections. The case highlights concerns regarding "keyword warrants," which could lead to privacy infringements by casting a wide net, potentially targeting innocent individuals. EFF advocates for stringent limitations on such practices, emphasizing the need to uphold the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures in the digital age. The organization warns that allowing these types of warrants

### Apache Under the Lens: Tomcat‚Äôs Partial PUT and Camel‚Äôs Header Hijack


üìä **TECH INSIGHT**


The article discusses two security vulnerabilities found in popular Apache projects: Tomcat and Camel. In Apache Tomcat, a flaw was identified in its implementation of the HTTP "Partial PUT" method, which could potentially allow an attacker to bypass security constraints. The article explains how this vulnerability arises from improper handling of partial content requests, thereby leading to unauthorized access to resources. Meanwhile, in Apache Camel, a vulnerability named "Header Hijack" was uncovered, where improperly sanitized HTTP headers could be exploited to execute unauthorized

### The double-edged sword of MCP: Understanding the threat landscape for AI workflows


üß† **AI ADVANCEMENT**


The article titled "The double-edged sword of MCP: Understanding the threat landscape for AI workflows" explores the dual nature of Model Compression and Pruning (MCP) in artificial intelligence. While MCP techniques enhance AI efficiency by reducing computational resources and improving processing speed, they also introduce vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries. These techniques may inadvertently simplify models to an extent where they become susceptible to attacks, such as model inversion and data extraction. The article underscores the need for a balanced approach in implementing
