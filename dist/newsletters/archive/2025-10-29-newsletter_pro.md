### Aisuru Botnet Shifts from DDoS to Residential Proxies


üß† **AI ADVANCEMENT**


The Aisuru botnet, initially known for orchestrating distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, has transitioned its operations towards the creation of residential proxies. This shift involves hijacking a vast network of compromised devices, repurposing them to reroute internet traffic stealthily. These residential proxies are then rented out, allowing users to mask their digital footprints and bypass geo-restrictions. This evolution in Aisuru's strategy highlights a significant trend among cybercriminals who are exploring more

### AI-Generated Code Poses Security, Bloat Challenges


üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY ALERT**


AI-generated code, while advancing software development, introduces notable challenges in security and bloat. The automation of code creation through AI tools accelerates the development process but often at the expense of producing overly complex and voluminous code, making programs difficult to maintain and optimize. Additionally, with AI models in some cases sourcing from publicly available code, there are concerns about inadvertently incorporating vulnerabilities or infringing on intellectual property rights. Developers and companies must navigate these challenges by implementing rigorous review processes and ensuring AI tools are used

### Memory-Efficient Backpropagation for Fine-Tuning LLMs on Resource-Constrained Mobile Devices


üß† **AI ADVANCEMENT**


The article discusses an innovative technique for optimizing the backpropagation process in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on mobile devices with limited resources. It addresses the challenges associated with memory constraints by introducing a memory-efficient approach that reduces the computational load without compromising the performance of the models. This method enables mobile devices to execute complex machine-learning tasks by optimizing resource usage, thus making LLMs more accessible for applications in portable devices. By refining the backpropagation algorithm, the proposed solution aims to

### New AI-Targeted Cloaking Attack Tricks AI Crawlers Into Citing Fake Info as Verified Facts


üß† **AI ADVANCEMENT**


A recent development in cyber tactics reveals a new AI-targeted cloaking attack designed to deceive AI crawlers into accepting and citing fabricated information as verified facts. This attack exploits vulnerabilities in AI training processes by presenting altered or fake online content to automated systems, which subsequently integrate these false data points into their knowledge base as factual information. This manipulation can lead to widespread dissemination of misinformation, potentially impacting any AI-dependent service or product, including search engines, recommendation systems, and content moderators. The discovery of this tactic
