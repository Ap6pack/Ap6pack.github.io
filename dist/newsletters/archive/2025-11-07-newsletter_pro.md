### Federated Learning with Gramian Angular Fields for Privacy-Preserving ECG Classification on Heterogeneous IoT Devices


🧠 **AI ADVANCEMENT**


The article discusses a novel approach to enhancing privacy and efficiency in electrocardiogram (ECG) classification using federated learning (FL) combined with Gramian Angular Fields (GAF) on heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Federated learning enables the decentralized training of machine learning models across multiple devices without transmitting raw data to a central server, thereby preserving data privacy. In this method, ECG signals are transformed into images using GAF, which capture temporal patterns as spatial features conducive for
