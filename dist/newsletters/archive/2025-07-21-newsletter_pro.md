### Behind the Clouds: Attackers Targeting Governments in Southeast Asia Implement Novel Covert C2 Communication


üìä **TECH INSIGHT**


The article discusses a sophisticated cyberattack campaign targeting government entities in Southeast Asia, wherein attackers employ a novel covert command-and-control (C2) communication technique. By leveraging legitimate cloud service platforms, these threat actors are able to mask their malicious activities and avoid detection by security systems. This technique involves using seemingly innocuous cloud-based apps as intermediaries to relay commands and exfiltrate data, complicating the identification of malicious communications. The attackers' strategy demonstrates an advanced level of operational security and innovation, posing

### Poor Passwords Tattle on AI Hiring Bot Maker Paradox.ai


üß† **AI ADVANCEMENT**


Paradox.ai, a company specializing in AI-driven hiring solutions, faced a significant security lapse when it exposed its Jenkins server to the internet without a password, as revealed in a report by security researcher Anurag Sen. This lapse potentially allowed unauthorized access to sensitive internal systems, raising concerns about data security and privacy. The vulnerable server could have provided access to private files and development technologies, posing risks not only to Paradox.ai's proprietary information but also to the companies that rely on its services for hiring

### PoisonSeed Hackers Bypass FIDO Keys Using QR Phishing and Cross-Device Sign-In Abuse


üìä **TECH INSIGHT**


The article discusses the tactics used by the hacking group PoisonSeed to bypass the security of FIDO authentication keys. By employing QR code phishing and exploiting cross-device sign-in processes, these hackers trick users into granting unauthorized access. The technique involves presenting users with a legitimate-looking QR code that, when scanned, leads them to inadvertently provide login information or approve access requests. The method capitalizes on users' trust in QR codes and the seamless user experience promised by cross-device authentication, underscoring the need for

### PREAMBLE: Private and Efficient Aggregation via Block Sparse Vectors


üìä **TECH INSIGHT**


Without access to the article directly from the URL, I can provide a general summary based on the title. The article likely discusses a method named PREAMBLE, which stands for Private and Efficient Aggregation via Block Sparse Vectors. This technique probably involves improving data aggregation processes by ensuring privacy and efficiency, potentially in contexts like machine learning or data analysis. The use of block sparse vectors suggests an approach that manages data in blocks to optimize computational resources while maintaining privacy constraints, which could be beneficial in handling large
