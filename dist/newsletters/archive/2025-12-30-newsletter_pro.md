### Chinese state hackers use rootkit to hide ToneShell malware activity


📊 **TECH INSIGHT**


Chinese state-sponsored hackers have developed a sophisticated rootkit to stealthily embed and conceal the ToneShell malware within infected systems. This tactic allows the attackers to maintain persistent access to compromised networks while evading detection from security mechanisms. The rootkit's primary function is to hide the presence and activity of this malware, making it challenging for cybersecurity teams to identify and address the breach. By employing these advanced techniques, the attackers can conduct prolonged espionage operations, potentially targeting sensitive data and critical infrastructure. This development highlights

### Latent Sculpting for Zero-Shot Generalization: A Manifold Learning Approach to Out-of-Distribution Anomaly Detection


🧠 **AI ADVANCEMENT**


In the article "Latent Sculpting for Zero-Shot Generalization: A Manifold Learning Approach to Out-of-Distribution Anomaly Detection," the authors introduce a novel method called Latent Sculpting, which enhances zero-shot generalization by effectively detecting anomalies in out-of-distribution data. This approach utilizes manifold learning techniques to capture the intrinsic structure of normal data, sculpting the latent space to isolate irregularities introduced by unknown distributions. By leveraging this refined understanding of the dataset's underlying manifold, the

### Procurement Power—When Cities Realized They Can Just Say No: 2025 in Review


📊 **TECH INSIGHT**


In the article "Procurement Power—When Cities Realized They Can Just Say No: 2025 in Review," the author examines the transformative shift in municipal procurement practices that took place in 2025. Cities across the globe have increasingly recognized their power to influence social and environmental outcomes through strategic purchasing decisions. By leveraging their substantial buying power, municipalities have prioritized sustainable, ethical, and locally-sourced goods and services, effectively saying "no" to suppliers that fail to meet these standards. This approach

### Pruning Graphs by Adversarial Robustness Evaluation to Strengthen GNN Defenses


📊 **TECH INSIGHT**


The article discusses a novel approach to enhancing the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) against adversarial attacks by employing adversarial robustness evaluation as a criterion for graph pruning. This method involves selectively removing potentially vulnerable edges and nodes from the network graph to fortify the GNN against malicious perturbations that could degrade its performance. By focusing on reducing the attack surfaces and refining the network structure, the approach aims to significantly bolster the resilience of GNNs, thereby improving their utility and reliability in critical
