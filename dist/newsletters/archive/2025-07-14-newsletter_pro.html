                    <p>This article presents a novel approach to improving the accuracy and privacy of diagnosing respiratory diseases using a framework called Federated Few-shot Learning (FFL). It combines the principles of federated learning and few-shot learning to enable healthcare providers to train diagnostic models collaboratively without sharing sensitive patient data. The framework enhances data privacy protection by using advanced encryption and decentralized data storage, ensuring that individual patient information remains secure. By leveraging diverse and limited data from multiple sources, this privacy-preserving system is designed to improve diagnostic performance</p>
