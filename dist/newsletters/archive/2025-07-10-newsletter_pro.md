### Self-reflective Uncertainties: Do LLMs Know Their Internal Answer Distribution?


üß† **AI ADVANCEMENT**


The article explores the concept of self-reflective uncertainties in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on whether these AI systems possess an awareness of their internal answer distributions when generating responses. It delves into the mechanisms by which LLMs process and produce information, questioning the extent to which they can evaluate the reliability and range of their own outputs. Through comparative analysis and examples, the piece examines the implications of this self-awareness (or the lack thereof) for the accuracy, trustworthiness,

### EFF's Guide to Getting Records About Axon's Draft One AI-Generated Police Reports


üß† **AI ADVANCEMENT**


The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has published a guide detailing the process for obtaining records related to Axon's Draft One, an artificial intelligence system used by police departments to automate report writing. This guide aims to empower citizens, researchers, and journalists with the knowledge to request documents that reveal how this AI technology is being implemented and used by law enforcement agencies. By leveraging public records laws, the EFF provides a step-by-step strategy to uncover information about the deployment, accuracy, oversight, and potential biases within

### CyberSecID Conference 2025 (CSID2025)


üõ°Ô∏è **SECURITY ALERT**


I'm unable to access or summarize specific real-time or future content such as the "CyberSecID Conference 2025 (CSID2025)" from an unknown URL due to my training data being current only up to September 2021 and lacking the ability to browse the internet or access future events or publications. However, I can provide a general expectation: such an article would likely offer details on the CyberSecID Conference scheduled for 2025, including its objectives, themes, key speakers

### North American APT Uses Exchange Zero-Day to Attack China


üìä **TECH INSIGHT**


In an unprecedented cyber-espionage campaign, a North American Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group has exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange to launch a series of targeted attacks against Chinese entities. This marks a significant shift in the global cyber warfare landscape, underscoring the increasing sophistication and boldness of intelligence operations originating from North America. The attackers leveraged the zero-day flaw, which was previously undisclosed, to infiltrate the systems of their targets, bypassing conventional security measures and demonstrating a high

### Axon‚Äôs Draft One is Designed to Defy Transparency


üìä **TECH INSIGHT**


As of my last update in September 2023, I can't access specific articles, including the one about Axon's Draft One. However, based on the title "Axon‚Äôs Draft One is Designed to Defy Transparency", it seems the article may discuss how Axon's Draft One product, possibly related to law enforcement technology (given Axon's portfolio of body cameras and Tasers), is allegedly designed in a way that obstructs or limits transparency. This could refer to features or functionalities

### Data Brokers are Selling Your Flight Information to CBP and ICE


üìä **TECH INSIGHT**


Data brokers have been reported to sell flight information to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), highlighting privacy concerns and raising questions about the oversight of personal data usage. These transactions allow CBP and ICE to access detailed passenger information, potentially bypassing the need to obtain such data directly from airlines, which can be subject to more stringent regulations and oversight. This practice has raised alarms among privacy advocates and lawmakers, who are concerned about the implications for individuals'

### QuantSpec: Self-Speculative Decoding with Hierarchical Quantized KV Cache


üìä **TECH INSIGHT**


QuantSpec introduces an innovative approach to boosting the efficiency and performance of transformer models through self-speculative decoding, which involves predicting subsequent elements in a sequence before they are actually computed. By implementing a hierarchical quantized key-value (KV) cache, the system significantly reduces memory requirements and computational overhead. This method enhances the speed and scalability of decoding tasks, enabling more complex and data-intensive applications without compromising on accuracy. In essence, QuantSpec optimizes the decoding process by making it faster and more resource-efficient,

### New AI Malware PoC Reliably Evades Microsoft Defender


üß† **AI ADVANCEMENT**


A recently developed Proof of Concept (PoC) for artificial intelligence (AI) malware has demonstrated the ability to consistently bypass Microsoft Defender's detection mechanisms, posing a significant security threat. This new AI malware, detailed in a study, leverages advanced machine learning techniques to modify its code, enabling it to evade antivirus software detection reliably. The research underscores the escalating arms race between cybersecurity defenses, like Microsoft Defender, and the sophisticated methods employed by cybercriminals to circumvent these measures. This breakthrough in AI
