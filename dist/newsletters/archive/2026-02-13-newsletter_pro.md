### Zero-Sacrifice Persistent-Robustness Adversarial Defense for Pre-Trained Encoders


🧠 **AI ADVANCEMENT**


The article "Zero-Sacrifice Persistent-Robustness Adversarial Defense for Pre-Trained Encoders" presents a novel framework designed to enhance the adversarial robustness of pre-trained neural network encoders without sacrificing their performance. The proposed method introduces a zero-sacrifice mechanism that effectively defends against adversarial attacks while maintaining the original accuracy and efficiency of the encoders. The system achieves this by incorporating a persistent-robustness approach, which ensures consistent protection over time. This advancement addresses a

### MELINOE: Fine-Tuning Enables Memory-Efficient Inference for Mixture-of-Experts Models


🧠 **AI ADVANCEMENT**


The article discusses MELINOE, an innovative approach designed to enhance memory efficiency in mixture-of-experts (MoE) models during inference. MoE models, known for their capability to scale and improve model performance, often face challenges related to memory consumption, particularly when deployed in resource-constrained environments. MELINOE proposes a fine-tuning method that optimizes the allocation of expert computational resources, reducing the memory footprint without compromising the accuracy or effectiveness of the model. This approach facilitates more efficient deployment of
