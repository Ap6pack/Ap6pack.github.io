### Beyond the bomb: When adversaries bring their own virtual machine for persistence


📊 **TECH INSIGHT**


The article discusses a sophisticated cyberattack technique where adversaries deploy their own virtual machines (VMs) within a target's network to maintain persistence. This method allows attackers to operate in a controlled environment, bypassing traditional security measures and evading detection. The use of VMs provides the attackers with a flexible platform to execute malicious activities, such as data exfiltration and lateral movement, without leaving noticeable traces. This new tactic highlights the evolving landscape of cyber threats and underscores the need for enhanced security strategies

### Why Isn’t Online Age Verification Just Like Showing Your ID In Person?


📊 **TECH INSIGHT**


Online age verification differs from in-person ID checks due to the complexities of digital identity and privacy concerns. Unlike physical interactions where a person simply shows an ID, online systems must ensure users are of appropriate age without compromising sensitive personal information. The challenge lies in creating secure and reliable verification methods that protect users’ data while effectively restricting age-restricted content. Technological solutions like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and digital ID platforms are emerging to address these issues, but the balance between privacy and security continues to be a
