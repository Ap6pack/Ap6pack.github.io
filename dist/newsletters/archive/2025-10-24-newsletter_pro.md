### Encrypted Client Hello: Closing the SNI Metadata Gap


üìä **TECH INSIGHT**


The article discusses the introduction of Encrypted Client Hello (ECH), an advancement in internet security that aims to close the metadata gap left by Server Name Indication (SNI). SNI, although essential for directing internet traffic to the correct servers, exposes domain names in plaintext, potentially compromising user privacy. ECH addresses this issue by encrypting the Client Hello message in the TLS handshake process, preventing eavesdroppers from accessing domain information. The implementation of ECH marks a significant step forward in enhancing
