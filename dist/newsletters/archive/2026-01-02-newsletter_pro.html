                    <p>The RondoDox botnet has been exploiting a severe vulnerability known as React2Shell to take control of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and web servers. This critical flaw allows malicious actors to gain unauthorized access and execute arbitrary code remotely, potentially compromising vast networks of connected devices. Security researchers have identified the vulnerability within systems using the popular React framework. As a result, affected entities are urged to apply security patches and updates promptly to mitigate the risks of these attacks. The relentless targeting by R</p>

                    <p>In 2025, various U.S. states attempted to implement laws aimed at restricting children's access to online content, citing concerns over safety and appropriate material. However, these efforts largely faced significant legal challenges, with courts often ruling against such measures on the grounds of First Amendment rights and the difficulty in effectively enforcing these restrictions. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) played a crucial role in these legal battles, advocating for the protection of free speech online and highlighting the overreach and impracticality of blanket censorship</p>
