### Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Offensive and Defensive Agents in a Simulated Zero-Sum Network Environment


üß† **AI ADVANCEMENT**


The article explores the application of adversarial reinforcement learning (ARL) techniques to develop offensive and defensive agents within a simulated zero-sum network environment. By leveraging ARL, the researchers aim to create adaptive agents that can effectively strategize and counteract each other, improving their performance over time. The study focuses on the continuous interplay between the offensive agent attempting to compromise the network and the defensive agent striving to protect it, highlighting the potential of ARL to enhance cybersecurity measures. Through simulations, the paper
