### Investigating Intersectional Bias in Large Language Models using Confidence Disparities in Coreference Resolution


üß† **AI ADVANCEMENT**


The article explores the presence of intersectional bias in large language models, particularly focusing on how these biases manifest in confidence disparities during coreference resolution tasks. Coreference resolution involves determining when different words refer to the same entity, and biases can lead to systematic errors, especially for marginalized groups. The study highlights that while language models have improved in many areas, they still exhibit biases against intersecting identities, such as those based on race and gender. By analyzing confidence levels, the researchers aim to identify and quantify
