### TopoReformer: Mitigating Adversarial Attacks Using Topological Purification in OCR Models


🧠 **AI ADVANCEMENT**


The article discusses TopoReformer, a novel defense mechanism designed to enhance the robustness of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models against adversarial attacks. Utilizing a method called topological purification, TopoReformer detects and mitigates distortions introduced by malicious inputs that aim to mislead OCR systems. This approach leverages topological data analysis to identify and remove perturbations by preserving the essential geometric structures within the input images, thereby maintaining the model's accuracy and reliability. The article demonstrates the effectiveness of
